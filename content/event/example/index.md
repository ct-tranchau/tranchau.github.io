summary: Cross-Species Single-Cell Annotation with Orthologous Marker Gene Groups.
abstract: 'Despite the widespread application of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in plant biology, the scarcity of known cell-type marker genes and the divergence of marker expression patterns limit the accuracy of cell-type identification in many species. To address this challenge, we have devised a novel computational strategy called Orthologous Marker Gene groups (OMGs) which can identify cell types in both model and non-model plant species. Our method does not depend on the complexity of cross-species data integration, thus is highly efficient, while still accurately determining interspecies cellular similarities of diverse species. We validated our approach by analyzing published single-cell data from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize, and confirmed its accuracy in identifying cell types in tomato root and shoot apex tissues. The robustness of our method was further demonstrated by a successful mapping of 259 cell clusters from 2.5 million cells across 15 diverse plant species and various tissue types. Our findings suggest that the OMGs method, informed by reference single-cell maps, can accurately annotate cell types for most monocot and dicot species. To facilitate the use of this method by the broad research community, we have launched a user-friendly web-based tool called the OMG browser, which enables effortless identification of cell types in any plant dataset. In this workshop, we will provide a step-by-step demonstration of how to use the OMG browser and associated R scripts to perform cross-species comparison and annotation of plant single-cell data.'
